# # Parameter: The function takes the integer which is to be converted to float.

# # Return Value: The function returns the float value of the number. 

# #floats are 9.0, 34.9, -89.0 etc.
    
# #to_i is a method which help us to convert value from different data like string, float into integer. This is also called typecasting of values.    [my_str= "58" ] => my_str.to_i => 58  [my_str= "69 b"] => my_str.to_i => 69
